                    <p>The Performance Audit covering the period April 2019 to March 2024 was carried out from August 2024 to December 2024. Status of efficacy of implementation of 74th Constitutional Amendment Act in ULBs in the Bihar was done through data collection and information gathered from the UD&amp;HD, Government of Bihar, reports of State Finance Commission (SFC) and the sampled ULBs. There were 261 ULBs (19 Municipal Corporations, 88 Municipal Councils and 154 Nagar Panchayats) in the State of Bihar, as on 31 March 2024. However, only 141 ULBs were functional during the financial years 2019-20 to 2023-24. These spread across nine Divisions/38 Districts, in the State. ULBs were selected by applying Simple Random Sampling (Revenue Division-wise), using IDEA application software. From each category of ULBs, samples of audit units were drawn in such a manner that one Municipal Corporation, one Municipal Council and one Nagar Panchayat were selected from each Division so that equal representation may be ensured. Based on the methodology, nine Municipal Corporations, nine Municipal Councils and eight Nagar Panchayats, were selected. The list of selected ULBs is indicated in Appendix-2.1. The sample also covers 26.06 per cent of the urban population of the State.</p>
                    <p className="mt-4">To form an opinion regarding the effectiveness of functions stated to have been devolved, audit selected the following two functions, out of 18 functions identified in the 12th schedule, audit analysed these in detail:</p>

                        <li>Public health, sanitation conservancy and solid waste management.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Apart from above selected functions, issues related to levy and realisation of Property Tax and Water charges were also scrutinised in order to assess the revenue buoyancy of the ULBs.</p>
                    <p className="mt-4">The audit methodology involved requisition of records/information, document analysis and responses to audit queries.</p>
                    <p className="mt-4">An Entry Conference was held on 2 August 2024 with the Principal Secretary, UD&amp;HD, in which the audit methodology, scope, objectives and criteria were explained. An Exit Conference was held on 10 July 2025 with the UD&amp;HD to discuss and obtain their views on the audit findings. Replies of the sampled ULBs have been incorporated in an appropriate place in the report.</p>
